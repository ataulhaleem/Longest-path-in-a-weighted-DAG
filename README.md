## Find longestpath problem in a weighted directed acyclic graph using Rust and Python3

This is very simple  linear time solution of the longest path problem in python3 (Python3_solution) using ready available python libraries.

There is another folder (Rust_solution) in this repo containing Rust based implementation of the longest path problem.
